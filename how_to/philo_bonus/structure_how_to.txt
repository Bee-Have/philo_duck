parse arguments

init vars : 
    - struct info
    - forks semaphores
    - death semaphore
    - pid for philos


first parse args, check that parsing is done correctly

then start making simple routine with fork() (dies after sleep_routine())

eat routine :
function taking in param info
function enter, waits, and then calls sleep
for now do wait in function

add semaphores for forks
semaphore fork is init in main
	sem is open in all children afterward
	each time there is a fork, wait twice (for two forks)
	each time it is done eating, post twice (for two forks)
add threads for check of vitals in forks
	- the open of the semaphore for death will happen there (the post also)	

add semaphore for death (kill everyone after sleep_routine)
