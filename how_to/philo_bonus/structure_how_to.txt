parse arguments

init vars : 
    - struct info
    - forks semaphores
    - death semaphore
    - pid for philos


first parse args, check that parsing is done correctly

then start making simple routine with fork() (dies after sleep)

add semaphore for death (kill everyone after sleep)

add semaphores for forks
add threads for check of vitals in forks
    - the open of the semaphore for death will happen there (the post also)
