init semaphores with :
	- init
	- open
(i don't know the difference between these two yet)
open : either create of open semaphore (if semaphore exists)

!!! each process must sem_open the semaphone to have access to it

semaphore name must start with /

sem_post : increment semaphore value
sem_wait : decrement semaphore value
	if the value is 0 : sem_wait will block (like mutex)

sem_close : when a process is done with a semaphore, process calls this

sem_unlink : when ALL processes are done with a semaphore, call this
